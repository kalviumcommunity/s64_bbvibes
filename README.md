Project Title: MoodMap - Real-time Vibe Tracker
Project Overview:
MoodMap is a real-time "mood map" where users can share their current vibe at different locations using a simple color-coded system. Whether it's a chill café, an exciting concert, or a frustrating traffic jam, users can mark their vibe under different categories (e.g., restaurant, park, event). The vibes expire after 30 minutes, ensuring the map stays fresh and relevant.

Key Features:
> User Authentication – Users log in to share vibes.
> Live Vibe Updates – Users select their vibe (green = excellent, yellow = chill, orange = good, red = bad) and assign it to a location.
> Category Tagging – Vibes are categorized (e.g., restaurant, park, work, event).
> Map Integration – Vibes are displayed on an interactive map.
> Auto-expiry System – Vibes expire after 30 minutes.
> Reaction System (Optional) – Users can react with emojis to a vibe.
> Leaderboard of "Trending Vibes" (Optional) – Shows locations frequently marked with specific vibes.
> Filters – Users can filter vibes by location, category, or time.

Tech Stack:
>Frontend: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Leaflet.js (for maps)
>Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (Mongoose)
>Authentication: JWT (or Firebase Auth as an option)
>Deployment: Vercel (Frontend), Railway/Render (Backend)
>Others: WebSockets (for real-time updates), Redis (for caching, optional)

Why This Project?
 >This project is both silly and technically challenging     ----->      it aligns with the ASAP guideline of picking something unconventional while covering multiple course concepts.
 >Demonstrates CRUD operations (creating, updating, deleting vibes).
 >Uses authentication (logins for posting vibes).
 >Works with MongoDB schemas (storing user vibes, expiry logic).
 >Integrates a frontend map component (Leaflet.js).
 >Implements real-time features (optional WebSockets for instant vibe updates).
 > Deploys full-stack using cloud services (Vercel, Render, Railway).

This project is a fun social experiment that could make exploring new places more interactive while also demonstrating proof of work across the full-stack development cycle.
